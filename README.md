# ParaTask-WorkStealing
# SOFTENG 751 Project 3 Group 22, 2018

## Project Brief

Parallel execution environments like ParaTask normally manage the tasks to be executed in one or multiple queues. For dynamic load balancing, these environments then often employ work stealing approaches, where a worker thread without tasks steals from the queues of busy worker threads. Investigate the different work stealing approaches and algorithms in literature. Important distinguishing points are: queue structures and organisation, victim selection, stolen chunk sizes etc. Implement your own work stealing algorithms in the ParaTask runtime and compare its performance to the built in algorithms using simple application benchmarks. 

## ParallelTask

Parallel Task (AKA ParaTask) is an ongoing project under the Paralle and Reconfigurable Computing (PARC) lab at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Parallel Task proposes a programming environment, in which programs can be parallelized with minimal changes required to the sequential version of object-oriented applications. In this effect, Parallel Task offers a set of language constructs that facilitate setting up and configuration of asynchronous tasks. The language constructs thereof are proposed in the form of extended Java keywords for the earlier version of Parallel Task, and are provided as annotations for the later generation of Parallel Task.

## Project Goal

Currently, in the ParaTask project, the work-stealing queue is implemented in the following way:

* Each worker thread maintains a local work queue of “LinkedBlockingDeque<E>” structure. New elements are added to and removed from the head (indicated by “first” in the LinkedBlockingDeque structure) of the queue using a last in first out (LIFO) policy, and are stolen by other worker thread from the tail (indicated by “last” in the LinkedBlockingDeque structure) using a first in first out (FIFO) policy.
* LIFO end: elements are (1) assigned from the global queue to the local work queues, and (2) popped by the work queues’ owner threads, from the same end of the it. In this end, the earlier the elements are assigned, the deeper they are stored, and the latter they are accessed by the owner thread.
* FIFO end: elements are stolen by other threads from the opposite end of the one they are added. In the stolen end, the earlier the elements are added, the earlier they are accessed by the thief thread.

This project aims to implement a circular blocking deque to replace the original one, which can grow when the deque is full. Local work deques in current ParaTask project are initialized with the size of max value of int, and they can be initialized with a smaller size when using a dynamic circular deque. The efficiency of the two work-stealing queue structures would be compared.
